# Aqui estamos

A map where users can show where they are to show support for a cause.

## Set up

Install plugin
Get a [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/web/)
Go to [Settings -> Aqui estamos](/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=aquiestamos)
and fill in your Google Maps API key

## Testing

Since cross-browser testing is hard, I use [![](browserstack.png) BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) to use many different browsers.
